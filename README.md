## A-shares-H-shares

###### I am exploring whether H-shares' momentum outperformance of A-shares is a leading indicator of CSI (Shenzhen Stock index) relative outperformance of HSI (Hang Seng Index). 

###### I'm using a few different indicators of momentum, including MACD, RSI as conditions for various signals, then backtesting returns using metrics like Sharpe, Sortino, Omega, max drawdown, cumulative returns. 

###### Used random forest for feature selection and fitting, using various features including MACD, RSI, VHSI (volatility proxy), CNH currency (offshore Yuan).
